# 0x40-web
A fairly complete HTML5/CSS3 Canvas + Web Audio clone of the 0x40 Hues Flash.

Should work on most modern browsers.

## Example pages:

[Christmas Hues

You can also have animations that sync perfectly with the beats of the songs. Inspired by Kepstin's Integral experiments.

Finally there's these, which hook into the Hues javascript events to do something fresh:

## Creating your own songs
0x40 Hues comes with an integrated editor to create new songs and inspect existing ones.
[Read how to use it here](https://github.com/mon/0x40-web/blob/master/docs/Editor.md) - it's easier than you think!

## Install (Make your own Hues website)
1. Start by downloading the latest [release](https://github.com/mon/0x40-web/releases). These are minified and load faster.
2. Put your respack zips somewhere they can be found by your web server. My hues have a `respacks/` folder under the main directory.
3. Edit `index.html`:
  1. If your html is in a different location to your `lib` folder:
    * Edit `workersPath` to point to the correct (relative) location.
  3. Edit the `defaults` object so the `respacks` list contains the respacks you wish to load.
  3. *Optional:* Add any extra settings to the `defaults` object.
  4. Upload everything to your server!

### Example settings  
```javascript
var defaults = {
    workersPath : "lib/workers/",
    respacks : ["./respacks/Defaults_v5.0_Opaque.zip", 
                "./respacks/HuesMixA.zip"
                ],
    firstSong : "Nhato - Miss You",
};
```

## Settings object  
See [HuesSettings.ts](./src/js/HuesSettings.ts#L10) for the possible options you
can put into the `defaults` object.

## Query string
Any setting that can go in the `defaults` object can also be dynamically specified in the URL.
For example: http://0x40.mon.im/custom.html?packs=BIOS.zip,kitchen.zip&currentUI=v4.20

There are two special settings here:
* `firstSong` can just be written as `song`.
* Anything given as `packs` or `respacks` will be appended to the respacks
  specified in the `defaults` object, as opposed to overwriting them.

## Building
Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). I used v16, but it should work with newer releases.
Install the required packages for the build:
```bash
npm install
```
Build with `npx webpack`. It will create a `dist` folder. For seamless
development with auto-reload, `npx webpack serve` - if you do this, put any
respacks in `public/respacks` so they're found by the local server.

## Adding a new beat character
There's a few places to change, here's a list:
- The documentation in the INFO tab. Found in HuesInfo.svelte
- The mouseover documentation & button for the beat in EDITOR. Found in HuesEditor/Main.svelte
- The list of beats in HuesCore.ts
- If you've added some new display behaviour:
  - A new beat type in the `Effect` enum
  - A handler in the `beater` function
  - Appropriate state for the effect in HuesRender.ts
  - Appropriate rendering code in HuesCanvas.ts
